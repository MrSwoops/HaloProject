# FMOD Unreal Engine Integration (adjust if you need to include binaries)
# If you are committing the FMOD integration and need its binaries:
!Plugins/FMODStudio/Binaries/
# The line above would explicitly include the FMODStudio plugin binaries
# while other plugin binaries might still be ignored by a broader rule like:
# Plugins/**/Binaries/*
